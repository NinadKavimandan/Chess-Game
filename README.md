# Chess Game
- Use <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install required packages
- Use <code>python app.py</code> to run the app on *localhost:5000* ("/" will do nothing now)
- *localhost:5000/login* for playing the game
- Here's the fun part! Once you enter your name and click the button, it will take you to a "waiting" page, and you will stay there till someone else joins :')
- Open *localhost:5000/login* in two tabs or two seperate browsers (better option) to see it work!
- Will add some AI part if no one is available to play with
